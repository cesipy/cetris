# TODO

- [ ] add collision detection mechanism in the gravity function. after each block is moved one line, it should check weather it collided with a fixed line
- [ ] use real pieces instead of one line
- [ ] fix error of weird block at first position
- [ ] make whole game structure simpler
- [ ] add score
- [ ] make size appropriate (height)
- [ ] fix bug on left edge
- [ ] rotation
- [ ] press down key to immediately move piece down(multiple iterations of gravity)
- [ ] switch the type of falling pieces randomly
- [ ] add color to pieces. each piece stores color in game_board
