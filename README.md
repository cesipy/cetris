# cetris - Cesipy Block Game

Cetris is my take on a Tetris alternative implemented in C-like style with structs instead of classes. Originally conceived as a means to learn C++, it evolved into a C-like program. (c structs instead of classes)

## How to play

Compile using `make`.

Play using `./tetris`.
